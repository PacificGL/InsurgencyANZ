### Insurgency ANZ Files - by [AUR] Ace
This repository has a complete collection of files I use and files I created for various servers and modes, that I host. It also contains some instructions for installing them on your own servers. This repo is updated regularly and is still a development branch, so some plugins aren't in working order yet and may be buggy. This collection of work is by [AUR] Ace, Founder of Insurgency ANZ and Co-Founder of Aussie Rebels.
