# InsurgencyANZ / Custom Theaters
Competitive theaters, used on Insurgency ANZ servers, by Pacific Gaming League or created for the Steam Workshop. All theaters are original. Some are also available on the Steam Workshop.

## Installation
1) Copy the desired theater files to `'insurgency/scripts/theaters/'`. You may have to create `'/scripts/theaters/'`
    * *eg. `'insanz_ladder_v1.theater'` -> `'insurgency/scripts/theaters/'`*

2) Open `'server.cfg'` in `'insurgency/cfg/'` and add `mp_theater_override insanz_ladder_v1`

3) Save the file, then restart your server. Enjoy!
