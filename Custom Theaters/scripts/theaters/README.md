# InsurgencyANZ
Skins, mods, plugins &amp; theaters for Insurgency 2014 (with Sourcemod)

# Summary
In this folder are theater files that can be used to run multiple types of fun game modes. All files have been created from scratch, using JBallou's "boltaction_only.theater" as a guide for my first attempt.
His work can be found at http://jballou.com/insurgency and is worth a read!

The theaters included will have descriptions and more info HERE -> http://tools.insurgencyanz.com/

# Installation
1) Copy the theater files to "insurgency/scripts/theaters/" (If "scripts" or "theaters" does not exist in the root Insurgency folder, then create them or copy the files across in the ready folders)

2) Open server.cfg and enter "mp_theater_override insanz_theater_file" (Replacing "insanz_theater_file" with the theater you wish to run). Save the file.
NOTE: Make sure "sv_playlist" is not there or commented out. This will make the server ignore the theater override.

3) Restart your server and you're done. Enjoy!
